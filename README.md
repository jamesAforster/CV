## James Alex Forster
I'm a life long learner with a huge amount of commercial experience who is hugely excited to be starting their career as a developer.

I've worked for sales and account management for many years, most recently for Makers Academy, where I was handling six-figure partnerships with companies like KPMG, Capgemini, Global, Expedia and others. Whilst at Makers I found my passion for the problem-solving and creative applications of software development, and decided to take the course myself. I went from being a complete code novice with minimal Ruby knowledge, to developing an application with several different API's, using new technologies and frameworks, within a tight 2 week timeframe.

## Skills
**Clean Code**
I love clean, maintainable, readable and scalable code. I find that the idea of software as a craft, and the philosophy of taking pride in the quality of your work is something that I am really excited by. I want other people to read my code and enjoy the experience, and find it easy to understand. This is an ongoing process, and I know that there is always more work to be done on that front!

**TDD**
TDD provides a framework by which to break down any problem into smaller chunks, and stop it from becoming overwhelming. The process of writing a feature test before anything else can sometimes feel a little superfluous, but I actively enjoy that approach to development, and ultimately it means that the code you write is cleaner, more direct, and full ytested.

## Hobbies
My housemates would probably tell me I played far too much guitar if they were not so polite. I spend a lot of time outside of work writing songs and working other little creative projects. Not necessarily with any grand intention, just because I enjoy the process of making things. You can listen to my soundcloud here if you fancy listening to some depressing music: https://soundcloud.com/user-656076887

I also run, read, meditate, listen to a lot of music (some of it very cheerful, actually), maintain a love of cinema and art, and like arguing about politics and all of the aforementioned topics at the pub.
