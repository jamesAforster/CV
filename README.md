## James Alex Forster
I'm a life long learner with a huge amount of commercial experience who is hugely excited to be starting their career as a developer.

I've worked for sales and account management for several years, most recently for Makers Academy, where I was handling six-figure partnerships with companies like KPMG, Capgemini, Global, Expedia and others. Whilst at Makers I found my passion for the problem-solving and creative applications of software development, and decided to take the course myself. I went from being a complete code novice with minimal Ruby knowledge, to developing an application with several different API's, using new technologies and frameworks, within a tight 2 week timeframe.

I'm driven, conscientious and people-orientated, and love working closely with others in a team and learning from them.

## Key Skills
**Communication**

My career before development was all about empathy, communication, understanding and trust. I feel like those are skills that are massively important in development; trust within a team when working to tight schedule, the importance of understanding briefs and communicating expectations to clients, empathising with others when they are struggling, and being able to be open and honest about your own technical challenges are all critical to being an effective developer.

**Clean Code**

I'm currently reading Clean Code by Uncle Bob and, perhaps unexpectedly, finding it quite an exciting read.

I am finding that I have a love for clean, maintainable, readable and scalable code. I find that the idea of software as a craft, and the philosophy of taking pride in the quality of your work is something that I am really engaged by. I want other people to read my code and find it easy to understand and change without having to ask me what this function does, or getting confused about similarly named variables. This is an ongoing (neverending) process, and I know that there is always more work to be done on this front!

**TDD**

TDD provides a framework by which to break down any problem into smaller chunks. Especially during the Makers course, this really stopped seemingly overwhelming problem get the better of you, and forces you to look at the smallest 'input => output' function. The process of writing a feature test before anything else can sometimes feel a little superfluous, but I actively enjoy that approach to development. It almost feels a bit ceremonial, and I really like that. Practically, it means that the code you write is cleaner, more direct, and, ideally, fully tested. 

## Education
#### Makers Academy (June '20 Cohort)
Through a super intensive 4 month program, involving a combination of individual and group projects, Makers encourages real-world development skills. We used a multitude of different technologies to learn a tech-agnostic approach to problem solving and teamwork.

We used a great range of development best practices: breaking down user requirements into user stories and developing applications using an agile development process, working in a team to very short deadlines and with changing project requirements half way through, diagramming and domain modelling to ensure a smooth development process, and many more.

## Hobbies
My housemates would probably tell me I played far too much guitar if they were not so polite. I spend a lot of time outside of work writing songs and working on other little creative projects. Not with any grand intention, just because it's fun and I enjoy the process of making things. Feel free to listen to my SoundCloud if you fancy listening to what has been described as [Elliott Smith without the talent or optimism](https://soundcloud.com/user-656076887).

I am also maintaining a blog about development, the jobhunt, and anything else related to technology. Also Mr Bean gifs. It's early days, but have a read [here](https://medium.com/@jamesalexforster).

I also run, read, meditate, listen to a lot of music (some of it very cheerful, actually), maintain a love of cinema and art, and like arguing about politics and all of the aforementioned topics at the pub.
